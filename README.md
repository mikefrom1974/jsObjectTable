# ObjectTable
(Generate Table from array of objects)

This is a class written in vanilla Javascript.

It is intended to simplify pulling data from API endpoints and displaying that data to the end user.

---
Usage: import the objectTable.js into your HTML file. See index.html and demoTable.js for example usage.

Note: The Javascript file is heavily commented and not compressed for ease of modification. You probably want to compress it for a production environment.
